# Flight-Computer-PCB
This is the second iteration of the flight computer that will be used on a thrust vectored rocket. The previous iteration was only a PCB, while this iteration also has components for PCB assembly. This PCB has 4 layers, with one dedicated to ground and one dedicated to power, in contrast to the previous 2 layer PCB. It also has an added ICP 20100 altiemter in addition to the previous BMP390 altimeter, and also an added BMI270 IMU in addition to the previous BNO08X IMU. The SD card, buck converter, and ESP 32 module all remain the same. I also added two more servo pin outlets just to be safe for the future. More iterations are still expected after I see how this one turns out.
